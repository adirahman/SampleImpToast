# SampleImpToast


On React Native Project(ImpToast)>App.js, i want to change
' import ToastModule from './ImpToast.js'; '
become
' import ToastModule from 'react-native-toast '

' react-native-toast ' is the module, that i have add on package.json

I try to change it, i face the problem  ' Error: Unable to resolve module `react-native-toast` from `App.js`: react-native-toast could not be found within the project.'
I check on node_modules the module 'react-native-toast' has already inside
